# Show Available Housing

A [0 A.D.](https://play0ad.com/) mod that shows all available housing.

Shows all housing units available to a player

When your population reaches the maximum allowed, the number of
available housing units is displayed.

It's sometimes useful to have extra housing in case some are destroyed;
this mod tells a player how much extra they have.

Example: 250/250+30
